Nexus Crowd Plugin
==================

This plugin works with Nexus 2.11.3-01 and Crowd 2.5.3

Later Crowd versions might work, I will soon update my Crowd installation and we will see.

This is a fork of https://github.com/PatrickRoumanoff/nexus-crowd-plugin.

The crowd integration is using the Crowd REST API.

## The plugin is not deployed anywhere. You need to build it yourself with `mvn install` and unzip the bundle into your `$SONATYPE-WORK/plugin-repository`folder.
